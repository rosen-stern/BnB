   - Player Hit Die
   - Player Abilities (all of them lol)
- add item cards to player page
- Player item cards 
- Player backstory cards?
- Player motive cards?

TO DO (stretch goals):
-Why do locations move when they're grouped together??
-Grouping note cards
- functionality when the window size is changed?
  - Position relative to parent (.container) ?
- Two "workspaces": one to show players, and one to not show players?
- Save page information in URL or cookies incase you lose the page / wanna continue the adventure?? Maybe download webpage? but sometimes the javascript breaks?
   - For some reason when downloading the page, after opening it the file doesn't have the draggable javascript anymore?

DONE:
- "sort" cards; have them order themselves nicely incase one gets lost or something
- Land cards below their respective buttons
- delete button on cards to get rid of one
- Add note card
- Change header color
- Added drop down (limited functionality)
- Maybe be able to change zindex of cards?
- Ability to resize cards
- Reset card size button back to default width (200px) and auto height (for both notes  & reg cards)
- CAN'T DELETE ITEM CARDS ON DM PAGE? > MOTHER'S RING??: turns out you can't have string characters like ' or " in an ID lmao
- Group cards by pressing a button (button changed to checkbox)
- Ungroup cards by pressing a button on one of the cards in the group
- Push cards to "visible" array, instead of using the actual picking array to track which ones are visible and which aren't
- Fixed randomize on DM cards, so now the cards are actually random each time, going through the entire array before shuffling and going through the shuffled array
-set a "landing spot" for all cards to land, then that figures out the overcrowded workspace!
- Added Change color, reset card size back
- Added goal cards
